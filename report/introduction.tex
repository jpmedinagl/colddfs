\section{Introduction}
\label{s:introduction}

Distributed file systems have become an important infrastructure in modern computing,
enabling scalable storage solutions across multiple machines. Systems like the
Google File System \cite{gfs} demonstrate how distributed architectures can be designed
to optimize specific workloads.
Understanding performance implications of design decisions in distributed file
systems requires extensive experimentation that can be costly and complex.

This report presents a distributed file system simulator designed to investigate
key performance characteristics and design tradeoffs in distributed file systems.
The simulator implements a GFS-inspired architecture with a single metadata node
coordinating multiple data nodes.

Originally the purpose of the simulator was to investigate complex block allocation
strategies such as in J. Liao et al. \cite{blockalloc}. However the overhead of 
implementing the architecture
and communication of the simulator meant various aspects of the simulator such
as parallelism and concurrency were not able to be implemented. This meant that
studying the effects of block allocation strategies turned out to be non-informative.
The limitations and future work of the simulator will be discussed in a later section.
